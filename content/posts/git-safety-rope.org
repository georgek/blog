When I was learning rock climbing I distinctly remember my instructor telling me "you'll
never get good until you learn to trust the rope".

This principle seems to ring true in many areas of life.  You'll never really push
yourself if you think there's a high chance of catastrophe.  In society we have things
like insurance to help with this.  For software development and version on control, you
have git.

TODO:

- Commands that can corrupt worktree: ~git reset --hard~
- ~git worktree~ to make a new worktree
