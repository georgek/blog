[{"content":" I love going to the cinema, but I\u0026#39;ve always been disappointed that I can\u0026#39;t see older films and I can\u0026#39;t see them when it\u0026#39;s convenient for me. There have always been ways to watch films at home, but even today when large screens and high-definition formats are ubiquitous, it\u0026#39;s just not the same as the cinema experience. There\u0026#39;s something completely different about the big screen that a TV in a living room can\u0026#39;t replicate. For that reason I\u0026#39;ve wanted my own home cinema for as long as I can remember. The problem is I don\u0026#39;t want to spend a lot of money on it.\nThe first iteration of my home cinema looked like this:\nHome cinema has a strong overlap with the audiophile world. You can spend as much as you want on it, and there will always be more. It\u0026#39;s not that it\u0026#39;s wrong to spend a lot on it; there are real benefits to the latest, high-end gear. But I think you can get 90% of the way there on about 10% of the budget, if that. However, you might have to make lifestyle sacrifices to save the most money.\nThis is my definition of a home cinema system. It will be opinionated and I make no apologies for that. You can do things differently, but I think the following features are non-negotiable:\nBig screen, at least 100\u0026#34; diagonal, filling your field of view, Full dynamic range, high quality audio, Highest quality media (usually blu-ray), Locally available; no streaming, Dark room. A note before starting: this will also take some dedication. It\u0026#39;s a real project. Saving money usually means building your own knowledge rather than paying for someone else\u0026#39;s. But if you can get there, the results are thoroughly rewarding.\nProjector Currently I think a projector is the only option. You can get TVs up to 75\u0026#34; or so, but that\u0026#39;s not big enough and they are so unwieldy at that size you might as well get a projector. The best home cinema projectors are the JVC DLA series. If you can stretch to a second hand X500 or newer, it will be great. The best value projectors are DLP projectors from makes like Epson, JVC or Panasonic. They are not as good as the JVC DLA projectors, and suffer from \u0026#34;colour wheel\u0026#34; artifacts, but many people enjoy them. Do not consider cheap Chinese projectors on Amazon. They are rubbish. Buy second hand from a good make.\nBe aware that projector bulbs have a finite life and are expensive. If buying second hand the seller should tell you the number of hours left on the bulb. Factor in the cost of a new bulb if you\u0026#39;re not sure. JVC bulbs can cost £300 new so really not cheap.\nYou need a screen. Don\u0026#39;t project on to the wall. The screen is really important, but you can start with a cheap Chinese one from Ebay. I used a screen on a tripod because it didn\u0026#39;t need to be installed. But better ones will need to be attached to a wall.\nYou don\u0026#39;t need 4K, you don\u0026#39;t need HDR, you don\u0026#39;t need high frame rate. A high quality 1080p projector at 24fps on a 120\u0026#34; screen is more than enough. Luckily this also means you don\u0026#39;t have to worry about any HDMI standards etc. You can just buy whatever is cheapest.\nThe Room Possibly the most important part of all of this is the room. First thing to get out of the way: a home cinema is not a living room. You won\u0026#39;t just be able to plonk your system down in the living room and call it a day. This is where the real project is. The rest is just buying equipment.\nThe ideal room is a squarish box shape with no windows. If you do have windows, chimney breasts, an L-shaped room etc. then it will make this more difficult, but you have to work with what you have. I wouldn\u0026#39;t suggest acquiring a new space in a budget home cinema guide.\nIf you do need your room to double up as a living room then you need to consider ways to convert it between these two very different purposes. This is especially true if live in a household that doesn\u0026#39;t completely share your enthusiasm for the project.\nFurniture can be just standard living room furniture. A sofa is ideal. It just needs to be comfortable and oriented towards the screen.\nLight control is extremely important for a projector to reach its potential. You need to block out external light sources but you also need to \u0026#34;deaden\u0026#34; the room as the projector itself will cause ambient light in the room which will kill your contrast. If you have windows, blackout curtains are a must. I bought full-length black blackout curtains and attached them to the walls near the screen. You can \u0026#34;open\u0026#34; the curtains if you want to convert the room back into a living room. A white ceiling is a disadvantage. Ideally it would be black. But you can get away with just having blacked-out walls.\nSound Good sound is just as important as a big screen. What matters is good quality speakers and amplifier and correct positioning of those speakers. Do not consider anything with Atmos or all-in-one kits that contain a handful of tiny little speakers. Your budget home cinema uses good old Dolby Digital and is at most a 5.1 set up. Your equipment will be mostly second hand.\nYou will upgrade your equipment in the following order:\nStereo set up Start with a high quality stereo system. You want speakers that can handle down to about 60Hz or lower, if possible, and a stereo amplifier.\nAn amplifier with 30W per channel should be fine (higher is better, but no point going above 80W per channel). Look for Japanese brands like Pioneer, Marantz, Denon, Sony or Technics. Basic amps last for decades and are readily available for very little money. As an example I bought a Pioneer A300X for about £50 without even trying to find a good deal.\nBookshelf speakers are cheapest but you need to position them at around ear height somehow. A couple of pieces of furniture are fine. Make sure you get hi-fi speakers, not PA or monitor speakers. Look up the frequency response and make sure it goes down to around 60Hz. Note that generally more capable speakers are physically larger and heavier.\nYou need to position them correctly. Basically you want a triangle with the speakers in front and you in the middle. Even a basic stereo system should sound a lot better than any TV.\nEnvironment The environment needs to be quiet. You don\u0026#39;t want any sources of noise. You also want to be able to play sound loudly without fear of annoying neighbours etc. This is so you can enjoy sound with full dynamic range.\nSubwoofer Next you can add a subwoofer. A good quality one from a make like SVS is worth it, but they do hold their value pretty well, so you might need to allocate more funds then your whole stereo set up. Make sure the subwoofer supports both high level and low level inputs. The low level input is preferable, but you need an AVR for that, so for now you will use the high level set up.\nAVR An AVR is a more advanced amp that will support multi-channel audio and digital inputs. You can also plug your subwoofer in with the low level input which you definitely should. These don\u0026#39;t hold their value well and as long as you get one without the latest HDMI standard you can get one for 10% of its original value.\nMore speakers If you get this far, you should first look into adding a centre speaker. But you really want it to match your front stereo speakers, so you might want to upgrade the whole set of front speakers to matched set, called an LCR (left, centre, right). However, note that the optimal position for the centre speakers is behind the screen and this suddenly starts to cost a lot more money.\nAfter that you can consider surround speakers, but these don\u0026#39;t add that much so do not consider them before doing the above. You can, however, consider them before a centre speaker if you are the only one using the cinema, as the ghost centre of the stereo set up should be good enough.\nMedia I use a NAS to store my media. You can find an excellent video series by Jeff Geerling outlining how to rip blu-ray media to a NAS, starting here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ8ijmy3qPo\nYou\u0026#39;ll want to keep the NAS outside of your cinema as it will probably have spinning media and be noisy.\nI use Kodi on a Raspberry Pi in my cinema to play back the content from the NAS. If you don\u0026#39;t have an AVR yet, you will need a USB analogue sound adaptor for it. I recommend the Behringer UCA202 which can be had new for around £20. If you do have an AVR then you don\u0026#39;t need this as you will use audio passthrough via HDMI, but at £20 this is probably cheaper to get started.\nConclusion If you stick to second hand stuff you can cobble together a great home cinema for less than £2000. It\u0026#39;s still a lot of money and takes a lot of work and research, but it\u0026#39;s a great project. If a partner exists, it helps a lot if they are understanding and have a similar frugal mindset. If you want this to look good in your living room, expect to pay many times more and put in a lot more work. Hopefully you don\u0026#39;t have to. Enjoy your home cinema journey!\n","permalink":"https://georgek.github.io/blog/posts/shoestring-home-cinema/","summary":"I love going to the cinema, but I\u0026#39;ve always been disappointed that I can\u0026#39;t see older films and I can\u0026#39;t see them when it\u0026#39;s convenient for me.

I know there are services you can simply sign up to and start writing, but that isn\u0026#39;t for me. I have two requirements for this thing:\nI can write using tools of my choice, I can host it anywhere. My tool of choice for writing anything is emacs and, for natural language in particular, org-mode. This is a bit like markdown, but better. For version control and deployment I use git.\nI also want to be able to host it anywhere because I don\u0026#39;t want to be tied to a host and, ideally, I don\u0026#39;t want to pay for it either. Back in the day it was common to use a dynamic site for a blog. Your content would live in a database and was served up using some backend process like WordPress. But that\u0026#39;s too expensive and places too many requirements on the host.\nWith that in mind, I\u0026#39;ve decided to use a static site generator. This is ideal as it means I don\u0026#39;t have to write raw HTML myself (although you can) but the output can be hosted anywhere. I\u0026#39;ve decided to use Hugo simply because it looks good, seems fast, well maintained, supports the workflow I want and, most importantly, supports org-mode.\nUsing org-mode with Hugo First of all, you set up your Hugo project by following the quickstart guide.\nThe next thing I did was install the PaperMod theme, as it seems like a decent default for a blog.\nNow, to start a new page using org-mode, you first need to install an archetype. These are essentially templates that Hugo uses to start new content. By default it comes with a markdown archetype in archetypes/default.md. You should add the following code in archetypes/default.org:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 #+TITLE: {{ replace .Name \u0026#34;-\u0026#34; \u0026#34; \u0026#34; | title }} #+DATE: {{ .Date }} #+DRAFT: true #+DESCRIPTION: #+CATEGORIES[]: #+TAGS[]: #+KEYWORDS[]: #+SLUG: #+SUMMARY: Now you can start a new org-mode post by running: hugo new posts/my-org-post.org. You\u0026#39;ll find your org-mode file ready to edit in content/posts/my-org-post.org. The metadata is pretty self-explanatory, but you can just play around with it.\nDeploying with Github Actions First of all, before you build or commit anything, add a .gitignore file:\n1 2 3 /.hugo_build.lock /public/* !/public/.nojekyll This will ensure you don\u0026#39;t accidentally commit your locally built version of the site.\nYou should also add the .nojekyll file to stop GitHub trying to run Jekyll (another static site generator) on your stuff. I\u0026#39;m not sure if this is still necessary but it can\u0026#39;t harm:\n1 2 mkdir -p public touch public/.nojekyll Now commit the .gitignore and .nojekyll files.\nTo publish your site you simply run hugo. This builds the site, including all articles that are not marked as draft, and puts it all into the /public/ directory. Now, you could simply copy the contents of that directory to a web server of your choice. That\u0026#39;s how we did it back in the day. This is how it meets my \u0026#34;can host anywhere\u0026#34; requirement.\nBut I\u0026#39;m lazy and I want it to be easier. I just want the site to build and deploy when I push my changes to git. This is actually remarkably simple to achieve with modern CI tooling such as GitHub Actions. Although, note: I won\u0026#39;t be tied to GitHub or GitHub Actions in any meaningful way, it\u0026#39;s essentially a glorified copy at the end of the day and I can always build my site on my own computer and copy the output the \u0026#34;old-fashioned\u0026#34; way.\nTo build using GitHub simply add the following to /.github/workflows/hugo.yml:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 name: hugo on: push: branches: [master] permissions: contents: write jobs: deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: submodules: true - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: \u0026#39;0.115.2\u0026#39; extended: true - name: Build run: hugo --minify - name: Deploy uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4 with: branch: gh-pages folder: public This pipeline is triggered by pushes to the master branch. It checks out the code, sets up Hugo with the same version that I used locally, builds using --minify (I don\u0026#39;t like minified pages generally, but the source is available freely so might as well save bandwidth) and deploys it to the gh-pages branch. Note that the source will live on the master branch (or any other branch), the built version will end up on the gh-pages branch, which will then be deployed to Github Pages itself.\nConclusion This should be everything needed to get started writing a blog (or any static site) with Hugo and hosting it on Github.
