Whenever I tried to find an explanation I&amp;rsquo;d find some vague thing like &amp;ldquo;they are sort of the same, but not really&amp;rdquo;.
The problem is I was thinking about these things wrong. One is not a replacement for the other; they exist in different planes of abstraction within k8s.</description></item><item><title> Odd Problem Accessing OPNsense Web UI via "OPT1" Interface</title><link>https://blog.gpkb.org/posts/opnsense-pfsense-reply-to/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 21:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.gpkb.org/posts/opnsense-pfsense-reply-to/</guid><description>I ran into a weird problem where I couldn&amp;rsquo;t access the OPNsense web UI using an OPT1 interface. The fix is easy, but it can be very confusing and it&amp;rsquo;s all caused by an unintuitive default.
tl;dr
If you can&amp;rsquo;t access the web UI via an OPT1 interface, try disabling the &amp;ldquo;reply-to&amp;rdquo; feature: https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/interfaces.html
I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with OPNsense inside a VM as I prepare to replace my current pfSense router which is no longer fast enough.</description></item><item><title>Resolving Private IP Addresses with pfSense DNS Resolver</title><link>https://blog.gpkb.org/posts/pfsense-unbound-private/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2023 23:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.gpkb.org/posts/pfsense-unbound-private/</guid><description>I use the Unbound DNS resolver built in to pfSense. By default the resolver filters out any results that are private IP addresses. Normally this makes sense: no public domain should have a private address. But sometimes it does make sense. For example there are some useful services like sslip.io that will resolve to any IP address that you like. So 127.0.0.1.sslip.io resolves to to 127.0.0.1. This is can be useful for local development, especially when working with containers and reverse proxies and the like.</description></item></channel></rss>
