It starts just north of Glasgow and ends at Fort William in the Highlands. It is probably the most famous of Scotland&amp;rsquo;s Great Trails (similar to the National Trails in England and Wales). In September 2024 I walked the West Highland Way over seven days with my partner Vicki.
Planning At 154 km the WHW will take most people between 5-10 days to complete.</description></item><item><title>Norfolk Coast Path</title><link>https://blog.gpkb.org/posts/norfolk-coast-path/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 23:33:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.gpkb.org/posts/norfolk-coast-path/</guid><description>The Norfolk Coast Path (NCP) is a waymarked, long-distance footpath and National Trail in England. It stretches from Hunstanton all the way along the Norfolk coastline to Hopton. I walked it with my partner Vicki over the course of seven days in September 2022.
Planning The NCP is around 135 km (83 miles) long and quite flat. The way is mostly on good, well trodden paths with some slower sections on sandy and shingle beaches (but you can often choose to walk inland on firmer ground instead).</description></item></channel></rss>
