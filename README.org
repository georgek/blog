#+title: Blog

This is the "source" for my blog. I use org-mode to write and Hugo to build a static
site.

To build the site you need Hugo.  Simply run: ~make~ and the output will be in
~/public/~.

To run the server locally and include drafts run: ~make dev~.

To add a new post, start a new subtree in one of the ~content-org/*.org~ files.
