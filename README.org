#+title: Blog

This is the "source" for my blog. I use org-mode to write and Hugo to build a static
site.

To build the site you need Hugo.  Simply run: ~hugo~ and the output will be in
~/public/~.

To run the server locally and include drafts run: ~hugo server -D~.

To add a new post: ~hugo new posts/my-new-post.org~ and the file will be in
~/content/posts/my-new-post.org~.
