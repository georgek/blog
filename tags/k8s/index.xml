Whenever I tried to find an explanation I&amp;rsquo;d find some vague thing like &amp;ldquo;they are sort of the same, but not really&amp;rdquo;.
The problem is I was thinking about these things wrong. One is not a replacement for the other; they exist in different planes of abstraction within k8s.</description></item><item><title>Resolving Private IP Addresses with pfSense DNS Resolver</title><link>https://blog.gpkb.org/posts/pfsense-unbound-private/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2023 23:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.gpkb.org/posts/pfsense-unbound-private/</guid><description>I use the Unbound DNS resolver built in to pfSense. By default the resolver filters out any results that are private IP addresses. Normally this makes sense: no public domain should have a private address. But sometimes it does make sense. For example there are some useful services like sslip.io that will resolve to any IP address that you like. So 127.0.0.1.sslip.io resolves to to 127.0.0.1. This is can be useful for local development, especially when working with containers and reverse proxies and the like.</description></item></channel></rss>
