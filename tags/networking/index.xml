I often have to switch between them and sometimes it&amp;#39;s useful to have multiple projects up at the same time. Recently I&amp;#39;ve found a way that makes managing these more enjoyable.
A single project with Docker Compose I use docker compose to manage local development instances of these projects. A typical compose file for a web project might look like this:</description></item><item><title>Resolving Private IP Addresses with pfSense DNS Resolver</title><link>https://georgek.github.io/blog/posts/pfsense-unbound-private/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2023 23:26:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://georgek.github.io/blog/posts/pfsense-unbound-private/</guid><description>I use the Unbound DNS resolver built in to pfSense. By default the resolver filters out any results that are private IP addresses. Normally this makes sense: no public domain should have a private address. But sometimes it does make sense. For example there are some useful services like sslip.io that will resolve to any IP address that you like. So 127.0.0.1.sslip.io resolves to to 127.0.0.1. This is can be useful for local development, especially when working with containers and reverse proxies and the like.</description></item></channel></rss>
