** Introduction                                                      :ignore:

Habits are really important. Long-term goals are too but, ultimately, habits are what
you are doing to yourself day in, day out. Your habits determine what goes into your
body (your diet), your physical condition (diet and exercise) and your mental condition
(sleep and everything else).

I think you should make reading one of your habits.

The benefits of reading are many. First of all, it's a great form of entertainment. You
can read anywhere; you won't disturb anyone. I love films, but the books are almost
always better than the films. Really. A good book can conjure images in the mind that a
film could never capture and these images never age. You'll never go back to a favourite
book and be disappointed at how bad the CGI looks now.

But, even more importantly, reading is one of the most powerful abilities you have to
understand and assimilate knowledge. Whatever your field of expertise, there is almost
certainly a wealth of literature available that you do not want to miss out on. If
reading is a habit, then you will have easy access to all of it. It's easy to forget in
this age of YouTube videos and podcasts but there is information in books that just
cannot be distilled into a 10 minute video.

This is a self-reinforcing habit. The more you read, the easier it will become and the
more you'll get out of it. Before you know it you'll be hooked!

** Make reading work for you

So why are there so many people who don't read at all? I think like any good habit you
need to make it work for you. This should not, and cannot, happen through discipline. It
needs to become a part of your life right next to eating, exercising and sleeping.

Here are some of my ideas, in rough order, which will help to make it part of your life.

*** Get books

Before you can read you need something to read. Get some books. They are everywhere. You
don't need to spend a lot of money. There are often book swaps where you can take books
for free (don't feel you need to deposit a book first; you need to start
somewhere). Check your workplace, your friends and families houses etc. for books you
can borrow. Check second-hand shops and online stores like Amazon. Just get some books.

*** Stop trying to read on screens

If you are reading this then you already have a screen device and access to the world
wide web. But if you still don't read much then this isn't working for you. Personally,
I can't read much from a phone, tablet or computer monitor. Try reading paper books or
an eReader (see next). The more general point here is to recognise what *doesn't* work
for you and try something else.

*** Get an eReader

Unlike most screens, eReaders use an "eInk" display which is much more like paper and
can be read in full sunlight. In addition, they are usually far lighter and cheaper than
tablets and phones and feature front-lit screens which can go really dim and warm which
is perfect for bedtime reading. I take my Kobo to bed with me every night and usually
fall asleep while reading it. I also travel with (it weighs as much as one small
paperback), so I'm never without books.

The one problem with eBooks is they are hindered by DRM. Platforms like Kindle are built
around DRM and I do not recommend using them. Kobo, on the other hand, will read any
eBook file you put on it. Find out where to acquire DRM-free eBooks for your eReader.

*** Always have your next book ready

One thing I find great about eBooks is you can acquire many more than you will read
without them being a burden. Use this to your advantage and acquire books as quickly as
you can. One sure way to break the reading habit is to run out of stuff to read. This
can easily happen with physical books if you are not careful, but there's no reason for
it to happen with eBooks. If you don't get on with eBooks then a library, book swap or
favourite bookshop can also help you to never run out.

*** Read easy books first

A reader and writer share a unique relationship and, many times, if you don't get on
with a book it's not you, it's them. Some people are put off by reading because they've
tried to read a book that just isn't for them. It might be too hard or just not your cup
of tea. As you read more you'll build your confidence as a reader and be able to say "I
don't like that" or even "this book isn't very good" but it's easy at first to think
you're a bad reader.

For this reason you should seek out easy books first. By this I don't necessarily mean
children's books, but books that have broad appeal that everyone loves. Don't listen to
the snobs. Read Dan Brown's /The Da Vinci Code/ or Alex Garland's /The Beach/. These are
page turners and popular for a reason.

*** Try different genres

I read mostly science-fiction, but other people like fantasy, novels, thrillers
etc. Read one of the most popular books from each category and find what you like. To
get you started, try /Foundation/ by Isaac Asimov (hard science-fiction), /The
Hithchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy/ by Douglas Adams (soft science-fiction), /Harry
Potter and the Philosopher's Stone/ by J.K. Rowling (fantasy), /The Catcher in the Rye/
by J.D. Salinger (novel), and the aforemention /The Da Vinci Code/ (thriller).

*** Get the classic works in your professional field

Get copies of these---real copies---and treasure them. But do bear in mind they might
not be /easy/ books. Knuth's /The Art of Computer Programming/ is a classic in computer
science, but it's not for the fainthearted. There might be easier ones to start with
like /Structure and Interpretation of Computer Systems/ (SICP).

*** Join your library

These still exist and they give you free access to many books. They also usually have
eBooks too, but they come with a time limit (like a real book). It's usually worth
joining the library as it doesn't cost anything.

*** Curate your own library

You shouldn't keep every book you read, but you should definitely keep some. Curate a
collection of books that you treasure and never want to be without and get rid of the
ones you don't need. Sell them, exchange them or give them away. Build your very own
library.

Besides having your essentials and favourites at your own disposal it's also nice to
lend these books to friends and colleagues when you wish. If you recommend a book to
someone there's a much higher chance of them reading it if you also hand them a
copy (and perhaps one day they might reciprocate!).

*** Let reading push out bad habits

I suppose it's possible to read an unhealthy amount, but it's not a common problem. On
other hand, it's very common to watch an unhealthy amount of TV or do an unhealthy
amount of scrolling. These are usually detrimental to other health habits like sleep or
exercise. Let reading push out the unhealthy habits and live in harmony with the healthy
ones. As mentioned above, I read every night before sleep. My reading habit and sleeping
habit are symbiotically linked. Do be careful about what you read, though. Fiction is
great before bed, hardcore textbooks not so much.

** Conclusion

Reading should be a daily habit that coexists with, and reinforces, your other good
habits. But like every good habit it needs to start somewhere and it needs to continue
unhindered. I thoroughly believe in making good habits a part of your life. I do not
believe in using discipline. If you don't like reading, you won't do it. Hopefully some
of the above will help you to get started, like it, build it into your life and never
stop! If you don't read then you are missing out but if you start reading, this could be
one of the biggest changes you've ever made.

** Introduction                                                      :ignore:

I love going to the cinema, but I've always been disappointed that I can't see older
films and I can't see them when it's convenient for me.  There have always been ways to
watch films at home, but even today when large screens and high-definition formats are
ubiquitous, it's just not the same as the cinema experience.  There's something
completely different about the big screen that a TV in a living room can't replicate.
For that reason I've wanted my own home cinema for as long as I can remember.  The
problem is I don't want to spend a lot of money on it.

The first iteration of my home cinema looked like this:

[[file:/cinema/cinema.jpeg]]

Home cinema has a strong overlap with the audiophile world.  You can spend as much as
you want on it, and there will always be more.  It's not that it's wrong to spend a lot
on it; there are real benefits to the latest, high-end gear.  But I think you can get
90% of the way there on about 10% of the budget, if that.  However, you might have to
make lifestyle sacrifices to save the most money.

This is my definition of a home cinema system.  It will be opinionated and I make no
apologies for that.  You can do things differently, but I think the following features
are non-negotiable:

- Big screen, at least 100" diagonal, filling your field of view,
- Full dynamic range, high quality audio,
- Highest quality media (usually blu-ray),
- Locally available; no streaming,
- Dark room.

A note before starting: this will also take some dedication.  It's a real project.
Saving money usually means building your own knowledge rather than paying for someone
else's.  But if you can get there, the results are thoroughly rewarding.

** Projector

Currently I think a projector is the only option.  You can get TVs up to 75" or so, but
that's not big enough and they are so unwieldy at that size you might as well get a
projector.

The best home cinema projectors are the JVC DLA series.  If you can stretch to a second
hand X500 or newer, it will be great.  The best value projectors are DLP projectors from
makes like Epson, JVC or Panasonic.  They are not as good as the JVC DLA projectors, and
suffer from "colour wheel" artifacts, but many people enjoy them.  Do not consider cheap
Chinese projectors on Amazon.  They are rubbish.  Buy second hand from a good make.

Be aware that projector bulbs have a finite life and are expensive.  If buying second
hand the seller should tell you the number of hours left on the bulb.  Factor in the
cost of a new bulb if you're not sure.  JVC bulbs can cost £300 new so really not cheap.

You need a screen.  Don't project on to the wall.  The screen is really important, but
you can start with a cheap Chinese one from Ebay.  I used a screen on a tripod because
it didn't need to be installed.  But better ones will need to be attached to a wall.

You don't need 4K, you don't need HDR, you don't need high frame rate.  A high quality
1080p projector at 24fps on a 120" screen is more than enough.  Luckily this also means
you don't have to worry about any HDMI standards etc.  You can just buy whatever is
cheapest.

** The Room

Possibly the most important part of all of this is the room.  First thing to get out of
the way: a home cinema is not a living room.  You won't just be able to plonk your
system down in the living room and call it a day.  This is where the real project is.
The rest is just buying equipment.

The ideal room is a squarish box shape with no windows.  If you do have windows, chimney
breasts, an L-shaped room etc. then it will make this more difficult, but you have to
work with what you have.  I wouldn't suggest acquiring a new space in a budget home
cinema guide.

If you /do/ need your room to double up as a living room then you need to consider ways
to convert it between these two very different purposes.  This is especially true if
live in a household that doesn't completely share your enthusiasm for the project.

Furniture can be just standard living room furniture.  A sofa is ideal.  It just needs
to be comfortable and oriented towards the screen.

Light control is extremely important for a projector to reach its potential.  You need
to block out external light sources but you also need to "deaden" the room as the
projector itself will cause ambient light in the room which will kill your contrast.  If
you have windows, blackout curtains are a must.  I bought full-length black blackout
curtains and attached them to the walls near the screen.  You can "open" the curtains if
you want to convert the room back into a living room.  A white ceiling is a
disadvantage.  Ideally it would be black.  But you can get away with just having
blacked-out walls.

** Sound

Good sound is just as important as a big screen.  What matters is good quality speakers
and amplifier and correct positioning of those speakers.  Do not consider anything with
Atmos or all-in-one kits that contain a handful of tiny little speakers.  Your budget
home cinema uses good old Dolby Digital and is at most a 5.1 set up.  Your equipment
will be mostly second hand.

You will upgrade your equipment in the following order:

*** Stereo set up

Start with a high quality stereo system.  You want speakers that can handle down to
about 60Hz or lower, if possible, and a stereo amplifier.

An amplifier with 30W per channel should be fine (higher is better, but no point going
above 80W per channel).  Look for Japanese brands like Pioneer, Marantz, Denon, Sony or
Technics.  Basic amps last for decades and are readily available for very little money.
As an example I bought a Pioneer A300X for about £50 without even trying to find a good
deal.

Bookshelf speakers are cheapest but you need to position them at around ear height
somehow.  A couple of pieces of furniture are fine.  Make sure you get hi-fi speakers,
not PA or monitor speakers.  Look up the frequency response and make sure it goes down
to around 60Hz.  Note that generally more capable speakers are physically larger and
heavier.

You need to position them correctly.  Basically you want a triangle with the speakers in
front and you in the middle.  Even a basic stereo system should sound a lot better than
any TV.

*** Environment

The environment needs to be quiet.  You don't want any sources of noise.  You also want
to be able to play sound loudly without fear of annoying neighbours etc.  This is so you
can enjoy sound with full dynamic range.

*** Subwoofer

Next you can add a subwoofer.  A good quality one from a make like SVS is worth it, but
they do hold their value pretty well, so you might need to allocate more funds then your
whole stereo set up.  Make sure the subwoofer supports both high level and low level
inputs.  The low level input is preferable, but you need an AVR for that, so for now you
will use the high level set up.

*** AVR

An AVR is a more advanced amp that will support multi-channel audio and digital inputs.
You can also plug your subwoofer in with the low level input which you definitely
should.  These don't hold their value well and as long as you get one without the latest
HDMI standard you can get one for 10% of its original value.

*** More speakers

If you get this far, you should first look into adding a centre speaker.  But you really
want it to match your front stereo speakers, so you might want to upgrade the whole set
of front speakers to matched set, called an LCR (left, centre, right). However, note
that the optimal position for the centre speakers is behind the screen and this suddenly
starts to cost a lot more money.

After that you can consider surround speakers, but these don't add that much so do not
consider them before doing the above. You can, however, consider them before a centre
speaker if you are the only one using the cinema, as the ghost centre of the stereo set
up should be good enough.

** Media

I use a NAS to store my media.  You can find an excellent video series by Jeff Geerling
outlining how to rip blu-ray media to a NAS, starting here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ8ijmy3qPo

You'll want to keep the NAS outside of your cinema as it will probably have spinning
media and be noisy.

I use Kodi on a Raspberry Pi in my cinema to play back the content from the NAS.  If you
don't have an AVR yet, you will need a USB analogue sound adaptor for it.  I recommend
the Behringer UCA202 which can be had new for around £20.  If you do have an AVR then
you don't need this as you will use audio passthrough via HDMI, but at £20 this is
probably cheaper to get started.

** Conclusion

If you stick to second hand stuff you can cobble together a great home cinema for less
than £2000.  It's still a lot of money and takes a lot of work and research, but it's a
great project.  If a partner exists, it helps a lot if they are understanding and have a
similar frugal mindset.  If you want this to look good in your living room, expect to
pay many times more and put in a lot more work.  Hopefully you don't have to.  Enjoy
your home cinema journey!
