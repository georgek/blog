** Introduction                                                      :ignore:

I love going to the cinema, but I've always been disappointed that I can't see older
films and I can't see them when it's convenient for me.  There have always been ways to
watch films at home, but even today when large screens and high-definition formats are
ubiquitous, it's just not the same as the cinema experience.  There's something
completely different about the big screen that a TV in a living room can't replicate.
For that reason I've wanted my own home cinema for as long as I can remember.  The
problem is I don't want to spend a lot of money on it.

The first iteration of my home cinema looked like this:

Home cinema has a strong overlap with the audiophile world.  You can spend as much as
you want on it, and there will always be more.  It's not that it's wrong to spend a lot
on it; there are real benefits to the latest, high-end gear.  But I think you can get
90% of the way there on about 10% of the budget, if that.  However, you might have to
make lifestyle sacrifices to save the most money.

This is my definition of a home cinema system.  It will be opinionated and I make no
apologies for that.  You can do things differently, but I think the following features
are non-negotiable:

- Big screen, at least 100" diagonal, filling your field of view,
- Full dynamic range, high quality audio,
- Highest quality media (usually blu-ray),
- Locally available; no streaming,
- Dark room.

A note before starting: this will also take some dedication.  It's a real project.
Saving money usually means building your own knowledge rather than paying for someone
else's.  But if you can get there, the results are thoroughly rewarding.

** Projector

Currently I think a projector is the only option.  You can get TVs up to 75" or so, but
that's not big enough and they are so unwieldy at that size you might as well get a
projector.

The best home cinema projectors are the JVC DLA series.  If you can stretch to a second
hand X500 or newer, it will be great.  The best value projectors are DLP projectors from
makes like Epson, JVC or Panasonic.  They are not as good as the JVC DLA projectors, and
suffer from "colour wheel" artifacts, but many people enjoy them.  Do not consider cheap
Chinese projectors on Amazon.  They are rubbish.  Buy second hand from a good make.

Be aware that projector bulbs have a finite life and are expensive.  If buying second
hand the seller should tell you the number of hours left on the bulb.  Factor in the
cost of a new bulb if you're not sure.  JVC bulbs can cost £300 new so really not cheap.

You need a screen.  Don't project on to the wall.  The screen is really important, but
you can start with a cheap Chinese one from Ebay.  I used a screen on a tripod because
it didn't need to be installed.  But better ones will need to be attached to a wall.

You don't need 4K, you don't need HDR, you don't need high frame rate.  A high quality
1080p projector at 24fps on a 120" screen is more than enough.  Luckily this also means
you don't have to worry about any HDMI standards etc.  You can just buy whatever is
cheapest.

** The Room

Possibly the most important part of all of this is the room.  First thing to get out of
the way: a home cinema is not a living room.  You won't just be able to plonk your
system down in the living room and call it a day.  This is where the real project is.
The rest is just buying equipment.

The ideal room is a squarish box shape with no windows.  If you do have windows, chimney
breasts, an L-shaped room etc. then it will make this more difficult, but you have to
work with what you have.  I wouldn't suggest acquiring a new space in a budget home
cinema guide.

If you /do/ need your room to double up as a living room then you need to consider ways
to convert it between these two very different purposes.  This is especially true if
live in a household that doesn't completely share your enthusiasm for the project.

Furniture can be just standard living room furniture.  A sofa is ideal.  It just needs
to be comfortable and oriented towards the screen.

Light control is extremely important for a projector to reach its potential.  You need
to block out external light sources but you also need to "deaden" the room as the
projector itself will cause ambient light in the room which will kill your contrast.  If
you have windows, blackout curtains are a must.  I bought full-length black blackout
curtains and attached them to the walls near the screen.  You can "open" the curtains if
you want to convert the room back into a living room.  A white ceiling is a
disadvantage.  Ideally it would be black.  But you can get away with just having
blacked-out walls.

** Sound

Good sound is just as important as a big screen.  What matters is good quality speakers
and amplifier and correct positioning of those speakers.  Do not consider anything with
Atmos or all-in-one kits that contain a handful of tiny little speakers.  Your budget
home cinema uses good old Dolby Digital and is at most a 5.1 set up.  Your equipment
will be mostly second hand.

You will upgrade your equipment in the following order:

*** Stereo set up

Start with a high quality stereo system.  You want speakers that can handle down to
about 60Hz or lower, if possible, and a stereo amplifier.

An amplifier with 30W per channel should be fine (higher is better, but no point going
above 80W per channel).  Look for Japanese brands like Pioneer, Marantz, Denon, Sony or
Technics.  Basic amps last for decades and are readily available for very little money.
As an example I bought a Pioneer A300X for about £50 without even trying to find a good
deal.

Bookshelf speakers are cheapest but you need to position them at around ear height
somehow.  A couple of pieces of furniture are fine.  Make sure you get hi-fi speakers,
not PA or monitor speakers.  Look up the frequency response and make sure it goes down
to around 60Hz.  Note that generally more capable speakers are physically larger and
heavier.

You need to position them correctly.  Basically you want a triangle with the speakers in
front and you in the middle.  Even a basic stereo system should sound a lot better than
any TV.

*** Environment

The environment needs to be quiet.  You don't want any sources of noise.  You also want
to be able to play sound loudly without fear of annoying neighbours etc.  This is so you
can enjoy sound with full dynamic range.

*** Subwoofer

Next you can add a subwoofer.  A good quality one from a make like SVS is worth it, but
they do hold their value pretty well, so you might need to allocate more funds then your
whole stereo set up.  Make sure the subwoofer supports both high level and low level
inputs.  The low level input is preferable, but you need an AVR for that, so for now you
will use the high level set up.

*** AVR

An AVR is a more advanced amp that will support multi-channel audio and digital inputs.
You can also plug your subwoofer in with the low level input which you definitely
should.  These don't hold their value well and as long as you get one without the latest
HDMI standard you can get one for 10% of its original value.

*** More speakers

If you get this far, you should first look into adding a centre speaker.  But you really
want it to match your front stereo speakers, so you might want to upgrade the whole set
of front speakers to matched set, called an LCR (left, centre, right). However, note
that the optimal position for the centre speakers is behind the screen and this suddenly
starts to cost a lot more money.

After that you can consider surround speakers, but these don't add that much so do not
consider them before doing the above. You can, however, consider them before a centre
speaker if you are the only one using the cinema, as the ghost centre of the stereo set
up should be good enough.

** Media

I use a NAS to store my media.  You can find an excellent video series by Jeff Geerling
outlining how to rip blu-ray media to a NAS, starting here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ8ijmy3qPo

You'll want to keep the NAS outside of your cinema as it will probably have spinning
media and be noisy.

I use Kodi on a Raspberry Pi in my cinema to play back the content from the NAS.  If you
don't have an AVR yet, you will need a USB analogue sound adaptor for it.  I recommend
the Behringer UCA202 which can be had new for around £20.  If you do have an AVR then
you don't need this as you will use audio passthrough via HDMI, but at £20 this is
probably cheaper to get started.

** Conclusion

If you stick to second hand stuff you can cobble together a great home cinema for less
than £2000.  It's still a lot of money and takes a lot of work and research, but it's a
great project.  If a partner exists, it helps a lot if they are understanding and have a
similar frugal mindset.  If you want this to look good in your living room, expect to
pay many times more and put in a lot more work.  Hopefully you don't have to.  Enjoy
your home cinema journey!
