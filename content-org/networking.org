* DONE Talos Linux on XCP-ng                         :k8s:devops:linux:xcpng:

** Introduction                                                      :ignore:

Talos Linux is a minimal Linux distribution designed purely for running Kubernetes
nodes. It's pretty neat, check out its website here: https://www.talos.dev/

I use XCP-ng in my homelab for running virtual machines and decided to set up a Talos
cluster there. I followed the excellent [[https://www.talos.dev/v1.8/introduction/getting-started/][Getting Started guide]] but there are a few
additional things I wanted to do right from the start:

1. Have the Xen Guest Tools (aka Xen Guest Utilities,
   xe-guest-utilities. xen-guest-agent etc.) installed on the nodes,
2. Have static IP addresses.

I also had to configure the installation disk as mentioned in the guide, to ~/dev/xvda~.

** Xen Guest Tools

Before configuring your nodes, you need to create a custom installation image. This
sounds really daunting, but actually it couldn't be simpler!

The way it works is you boot from the standard bare metal installation image, like
metal-amd64, but then you provide an installation image to Talos as a configuration
option (by default it's the same image you booted from).

To create a custom image, go to the [[https://factory.talos.dev/][Talos Image Factory]] and follow the instructions. You
want a bare metal image, latest version of Talos, and amd64 architecture. The important
part is the System Extensions step. Search for "xen" and you'll find
~siderolabs/xen-guest-agent~. Tick this extension and click next.

At the end you'll see a bunch of links to your custom image. Copy the "Initial Install"
link like
~factory.talos.dev/installer/53b20d86399013eadfd44ee49804c1fef069bfdee3b43f3f3f5a2f57c03338ac:v1.8.2~.
Put this into your ~controlplane.yaml~ and ~worker.yaml~ under ~machine.install.image~
before you run ~talosctl apply-config~.

Alternatively, if you haven't yet generated the configs, you can include the image in
them by default:

#+begin_src sh
talosctl gen config talos-cluster https://<controlplane_addr>:6443 \
         --install-image factory.talos.dev/installer/53b20d86399013eadfd44ee49804c1fef069bfdee3b43f3f3f5a2f57c03338ac:v1.8.2
#+end_src

** Static IP addresses

By default Talos will use DHCP and give each node a random hostname. This might well be
all you need if you register DHCP leases in your DNS server. There's not really any need
to use IP addresses if you use DNS. But I still like to set a static network config for
servers. Call it an old habit.

If you have an IP address in mind for a single controlplane node you can go ahead and
use this IP address in configs before you actually configure any nodes with that IP
address. It will all sort itself out later.

To make this easier I first disabled [[https://www.talos.dev/v1.8/talos-guides/network/predictable-interface-names/][predictable interface names]]. This is the setting
that gives interfaces names like ~enx78e7d1ea46da~. To do this, when booting the ISO
edit the Linux command line by pressing ~e~ at the GRUB menu. Add the option
~net.ifnames=0~ somewhere on the Linux command.

Now, when a node is booted, check the IP address it got from DHCP using Talos's handy
VGA console (e.g. ~192.168.2.6~). You can now check its network interfaces like so:

#+begin_src sh
talosctl get links --insecure --nodes 192.168.2.6
#+end_src

It should just have something like ~eth0~ now.

Now prepare patch files for each node. These will get applied after you configure the
node with either ~controlplane.yaml~ or ~worker.yaml~:

#+begin_src yaml
machine:
  network:
    hostname: <your-hostname>
    interfaces:
      - interface: eth0
        addresses:
          - <ip_address e.g. 192.168.8.1/16>
        routes:
          - network: 0.0.0.0/0
            gateway: <your_router>
    nameservers:
      - <your_nameserver>
#+end_src

Apply each node's patch like so:

#+begin_src sh
talosctl patch mc --talosconfig talosconfig -e <controlplane_addr> -n <node_addr> \
         --patch-file patches/your-hostname.yaml
#+end_src

You should see the network configuration update immediately.

Note for updating controlplane nodes you can use any controlplane node as the ~-e~
parameter, including itself. Remember that once you configure a controlplane to update
the address in your ~-e~ option for subsequent patches!

** Conclusion

All in all I found it incredibly easy to bootstrap a cluster using Talos on XCP-ng. The
only thing I found confusing was how the extensions worked, but it all made sense once I
discovered the Image Factory.

In writing this up I realise that the static network config part is probably
unnecessary. Perhaps in a future cluster I'll experiment with using DHCP and not
worrying about IP addresses at all.

Happy scheduling!

** Introduction                                                      :ignore:

Network Address Translation (NAT) is ubiquitous on the internet today, but it wasn't
supposed to be this way. It's been possible for a couple of decades now to "upgrade" the
internet and restore its original design, but this requires the cooperation of thousands
of companies with conflicting interests. It's a dream of many, but one that seems
forever distant.

But a funny thing seems to have happened: some people have been conditioned to expect
NAT and think the prospect of a real internet is scary. I think this comes down to not
understanding what a firewall is. A firewall is a good thing to have, but NAT is not a
firewall.

** What is the Internet?

The internet is a single global network capable of connecting any computer in the world
to any other computer. When you connect a computer to the internet in the UK it is
immediately capable of low latency communication with any computer currently online in
Australia, the USA, India, even Antarctica. All you require is a cheap local ISP, and
the internet takes care of the rest. It's quite remarkable and worth reflecting on how
well it works.

This is all enabled by a suite of protocols called the Internet Protocol suite.

* DONE Kubernetes Ingress vs Load Balancer                       :k8s:devops:

:END:

** Introduction                                                      :ignore:

I've been using Kubernetes successfully for a while, but I felt like I still didn't
fully understand the difference between an Ingress and a LoadBalancer. Whenever I tried
to find an explanation I'd find some vague thing like "they are sort of the same, but
not really".

The problem is I was thinking about these things wrong. One is not a replacement for
the other; they exist in different planes of abstraction within k8s. For someone who
just wants to deploy a web service, there are three orthogonal concepts you need to
understand in k8s.

** Workloads

The first thing you need to do is get your workload on to the cluster. As we're talking
about web apps, the workload we're talking about is a web server. Somehow you need to
run some kind of web server on the cluster. It doesn't matter if you're trying to deploy
a static site or a fully dynamic monolithic web app, the workload is a web server.

In this plane, Kubernetes doesn't know about web servers. It's designed to be more
general than that. It only knows about running workloads. The way you deliver a
webserver as a workload is to package it into a container image. Kubernetes does know
how to run a container image.

Building a container image is assumed knowledge here, but generally you would write a
~Dockerfile~ with the ~CMD~ set to run a webserver and an ~EXPOSE~ to set the port the
webserver is listening on.

The smallest deployable unit in K8s is actually a Pod, but a typical Pod consists of
just one container.

You can deploy your webserver as a Pod and it will run. When it runs the cluster will
automatically assign a unique IP address to the Pod that is valid within the
cluster. That was easy! But there are a couple of problems.

First note that the workload plane doesn't understand or care what type of workload you
are deploying. We want to deploy a service and running the server is an important part
of that, but how can clients access this? The workload plane gives you random
cluster-internal IP addresses for your Pods. That's it. As far as it's concerned you
might be running some batch job and that's all you need.

Secondly, running a Pod only ensures it runs one time. If it crashes, the node crashes
or it's evicted from a node, it won't get run again.

To get a workload to keep running you use a ReplicaSet. This is a configuration that
ensures a number of Pods are running at all times. If one of the Pods disappears for
whatever reason, the ReplicaSet will ensure it gets replaced. You can change the number
of replicas in a ReplicaSet at any time (referred to as scaling up or down). But you
can't change the Pod configuration. In particular, you can't change the image used. The
only way to upgrade your service would be to remove the ReplicaSet and add another one,
which would take the service down.

So we don't tend to use ReplicaSets directly. Instead we use a Deployment. A Deployment
is similar to a ReplicaSet but it allows you to change the image used by the
Pods. Changing the image causes a rollout to take place whereby each Pod is replaced
with the new version one by one. At each stage there are always the desired number of
replicas up and running.

A key thing to understand is that the Pods themselves are ephemeral. At any time the
actual Pods running your workload, and therefore their IP addresses, can change for
various reasons. The Deployment only makes sure the right *number* of Pods are
running at any one time. We'll need some way to access the Pods reliably. That's
addressed in the Services plane.

So to recap, use Deployments to ensure your desired workloads are running on the cluster
with the requested configurations etc. For a web app these workloads are webservers
packaged up as containers. The workload plane is only concerned with making sure your
webservers are running. It isn't concerned with how you or anyone else access those
webservers (because it doesn't even know or care that they are webservers).

** Services

The workload plane makes sure things run but doesn't provide a stable service (as the
underlying Pods will change). The services plane provides a stable service, but doesn't
care how things are run (that is handled by the workload plane).

A Service is a way to expose a number of (inherently unstable) Pods as a stable
service. You do that by labelling the Pods in the workload plane and selecting those
pods in the Service. The workload plane is free to do what it wants with those Pods
(move, upgrade, scale up/down etc.), but as long as the labels stay the same, your
service will remain available, it will just be backed by different Pods.

Note that the service plane is not specific to web services at all. These are just TCP
or UDP services and could be anything: a database, a message queue or, indeed, a
webserver, but no assumptions are made.

There are three[fn:1] levels (called "types") of Service, each building upon the last:

[fn:1] Actually, there is a fourth called ExternalName but, as far as I can tell, this
is completely different and doesn't build on the other three. It's more like an internal
CNAME record for an external service.

*** ClusterIP (the default)

This gives your service a stable internal cluster IP address, and a name in the internal
DNS server, like ~my-service.my-namespace~. If your service is currently backed by three
Pods, accessing the service IP address balances the traffic between those three Pods. No
matter what happens to the Pods, the service IP address stays the same, which means
other workloads in your cluster can access the service. But you still can't access it
from outside of the cluster.

*** NodePort

In addition to the above, this opens a high-numbered port on each node (the same port on
each node) through which you can access the service from *outside* of the cluster. What
this means is you could connect to any of the nodes in your cluster on the allocated
port (say 30233) and connect to the service.

Using a high-numbered port isn't expected for a web service, but in this configuration
you could have some external load balancer routing web traffic into your cluster through
the node ports.

Note that although you can access the service from outside the cluster, most clusters
themselves are not on the public internet but rather behind a firewall. So it will only
be internet accessible if the load balancer is configured that way.

*** LoadBalancer

In addition to the above, this also provisions a load balancer in the configuration
described above, usually allowing you to access services on the cluster from *outside of
your firewall* (ie. the internet). This happens automatically on cloud platforms but
there are bare metal options like MetalLB and even "fake" options like ServiceLB (used
in k3s).

So should you use a LoadBalancer for your web service? You can, but probably not. As
mentioned above the service plane is merely concerned with routing network traffic to
the right place. There's nothing HTTP specific here. So if you were to use LoadBalancer
you'd be responsible for things like TLS termination and you'd need one LoadBalancer per
service which could be expensive (generally you'll get a publicly routeable IPv4 address
per LoadBalancer).

A more common configuration is to use ingresses for web services, which we'll see next.

To recap, the service layer is concerned with providing a stable address and routing
network traffic from that address to the underlying Pods inside the cluster. It is not
concerned with how those Pods get provisioned. It is also not concerned with what kind
of network service it is (be it a web service or otherwise).

** Ingresses

Ingresses are specific to web services. The K8s docs are a little hesitant to say this
and I suspect they want to keep the concept more general, but in practice this is going
to be used primarily for web services. Ingresses allow you do things like route HTTP
traffic to different backends based on the hostname and/or path. If you've ever used
Apache VirtualHosts or written an Nginx config yourself this should be familiar. It is
also similar to things like API Gateway as used with AWS Lambda (in fact, Ingress is
in the process of being replaced by the "Gateway API" in K8s).

An Ingress maps rules to services, for example hostname ~www.example.com~ and path
~/api/~ can be set to a backend service ~my-service~. By itself the Ingress, like a
Deployment, is like a request for a desired state. To achieve anything it requires an
Ingress Controller to be installed in the cluster. It is the Ingress Controller that
actually does the routing. A typical Ingress Controller is Nginx.

It is this Ingress Controller that will typically be deployed as a Service with type
LoadBalancer. A typical configuration will be to have your web services deployed as
Deployments, exposed as Services (type ClusterIP) and mapped using Ingresses. The
Ingress Controller will be deployed as a Service type LoadBalancer and receive TCP
traffic from the external load balancer, perform TLS termination and route it to the
desired underling Service, which will then route it to the correct Pods.

** Conclusion

Hopefully this clears up the difference between Ingress and LoadBalancer. As you can
see, they are quite different because they essentially live in separate planes of
abstraction. An Ingress is HTTP specific and is concerned with routing HTTP requests to
the right backend. A LoadBalancer is a type of Service which is only concerned with
routing network traffic to Pods---it doesn't know about HTTP. They work together to give
a common and convenient configuration for deploying web apps.

* DONE Odd Problem Accessing OPNsense Web UI via "OPT1" Interface :opnsense:pfsense:routing:
CLOSED: [2024-04-24 Wed 21:50]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: opnsense-pfsense-reply-to
:END:

I ran into a weird problem where I couldn't access the OPNsense web UI using an OPT1
interface. The fix is easy, but it can be very confusing and it's all caused by an
unintuitive default.

#+begin_tldr
#+begin_tldr-heading
tl;dr
#+end_tldr-heading
If you can't access the web UI via an OPT1 interface, try disabling the "reply-to"
feature: https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/interfaces.html
#+end_tldr

I've been playing around with OPNsense inside a VM as I prepare to replace my current
pfSense router which is no longer fast enough.  I have a quad network card which is
passed through at the hardware level and, in addition, I have the virtual network
interface provided by the hypervisor, xcp-ng.

I thought it would be a nice idea to set the router up via the xcp-ng interface. That
would mean I could configure it entirely before swapping out my old router. In
particular I'd enable a DHCP server and set the IP address of the LAN interface to the
same as my current router without having to segregate it from my network.

So I set two of the physical interface to LAN and WAN, as you do, and enabled the xcp-ng
interface as the "OPT1" interface. OPT1 was set to be configured via DHCP so it would
just be a regular device on my network. I then added a firewall rule enabling access to
the web UI via OPT1.

But it didn't work.

I searched around a bit online and it seems loads of people have the same, or similar,
problems with accessing the web UI over OPT1. What was frustrating is there didn't
appear to be any answers. Most people suggested adding firewall rules, but I had already
done this; the traffic wasn't getting blocked.

** The problem

It turns out that any interface with an upstream gateway is considered a WAN-type
interface by OPNsense (and pfSense). This is the case when configuring via DHCP. The
upstream gateway is my network's router. This is the first thing I hadn't fully
understood.

The second thing is that both OPNsense and pfSense set a rather strange rule on any
WAN-type interface. This is apparently a very old default and unlikely to change, but it
can also be useful in some situations. Essentially, WAN-type interfaces reply to any
traffic, no matter where it comes from, via the upstream gateway. This is called
"reply-to".

I'm still a little unsure about what exactly was happening. At one point while I was
troubleshooting I had two interfaces plugged into my network, both configured via
DHCP. I saw packets entering the OPT1 interface then leaving to my network's router via
the other interface! Whatever happened, though, the replies were not making it back to
my PC.

** The solution

The solution is to disable reply-to somehow. This can be done globally or with firewall
rules. Now that I understand the problem, I went for the latter. It's really quite
simple in the end. Make a rule on OPT1 with the following settings:

- Action: Pass
- Direction: in
- TCP/IP: IPv4+IPv6
- Protocol: TCP
- Source: any
- Destination: This Firewall
- Ports: HTTP
- Reply-to: Disable (the most important; under advanced)

This is similar to the anti-lockout rule that would be added to the LAN interface, but
OPNsense doesn't add it to OPT1.

Hope this helps someone out of a similar situation! Happy routing!

* DONE Resolving Private IP Addresses with pfSense DNS Resolver :pfsense:dns:k8s:
CLOSED: [2023-10-01 Sun 23:10]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: pfsense-unbound-private
:END:

I use the Unbound DNS resolver built in to pfSense.  By default the resolver filters out
any results that are private IP addresses.  Normally this makes sense: no public domain
should have a private address.  But sometimes it does make sense.  For example there are
some useful services like [[https://sslip.io/][sslip.io]] that will resolve to any IP address that you like.
So ~127.0.0.1.sslip.io~ resolves to to ~127.0.0.1~.  This is can be useful for local
development, especially when working with containers and reverse proxies and the like.

To allow Unbound to resolve these properly an extra configuration needs to be added.
pfSense has no GUI config so this must be added under the custom options in the DNS
resolver settings in pfSense.  My options look like this:

#+begin_src conf
server:
private-domain: "azmk8s.io"
private-domain: "nip.io"
private-domain: "sslip.io"
private-domain: "traefik.me"
